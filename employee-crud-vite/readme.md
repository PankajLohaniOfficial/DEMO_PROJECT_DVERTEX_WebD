# Employee CRUD Vite

## Project Overview

**Employee CRUD Vite** is a modern web application built with **React** and **Vite**, designed to manage employee records efficiently.  
It demonstrates complete **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with **live API integration**, ensuring that changes made to the employee list are reflected in real time from the backend dataset.

### Key Features
- **Create**: Add new employees with details such as name, role, and department.
- **Read**: Fetch and display the latest employee list from the API.
- **Update**: Edit and update employee details directly on the live dataset.
- **Delete**: Remove employees, with changes instantly reflected in the API data.
- Optimized build and fast development powered by **Vite**.

### Purpose
This project serves as a practical example of building a modern **full CRUD application** with **React + Vite** and **API integration**.  
It can be used as a reference for projects that require syncing data between a frontend and backend in real time.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (with Hooks & functional components)  
- **Build Tool**: Vite  
- **Styling**: CSS / Tailwind (optional, based on implementation)  -> Here I have used CSS MODULES (.module.css) i.e simple css just used CSS by modules..
- **State Management**: React Hooks / Context API  
- **Backend / API**: RESTful API for live data updates
